# Tavern-python-Bridge

A simple bridge that lets Python talk to SillyTavern. Send messages from Python and get bot responses back.

## Quick Start

1. Install in SillyTavern:
   - Go to **Extensions** > **Install from Git**
   - Enter: `https://github.com/Dopamage/Tavern-python-Bridge`
   - Click Install & restart SillyTavern

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python st_chat.py
   ```
   (It'll install any missing packages automatically)

That's it! Type messages in the Python console and they'll show up in SillyTavern. Bot responses will come back to the console.

## Need Help?

- Make sure SillyTavern is running
- Check if port 5001 is free
- Look at browser console (F12) for any errors

## Want to use it in your own Python stuff?

Check out `st_chat.py` - you can import the bridge class and use it in your own code.
